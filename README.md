## Welcome to Líká!

Líká is a minimalistic auxiliary language (auxlang) blending **logical clarity** (unique markers) and **emotional nuance** (diphthong-based tones). With only 236 roots and room for 64 more “earned” through community use, Líká offers a clear, expressive system for global communication. Currently in beta (v0.55), we invite you to try Líká, share feedback, and propose new roots to shape its future!

**Try it**:
- “lu tox ji” = Person moves thing (logical clarity with -x marker).
- “A kan fifi loie” = I love dear friend (emotional nuance with fifi and tones).

## Why Líká?
Líká addresses common conlang challenges:
- **Clarity over ambiguity** (unlike Toki Pona): Markers (-x, -f, -th) ensure precise roles, e.g., “lu kan fif tox gi” = Person gives thing to friend.
- **Completeness** (unlike Quenya/Sindarin): Fully defined grammar and lexicon, covering all NSM primes for universal concepts.
- **Simplicity** (unlike Na’vi): Minimal roots, isolating grammar, and diacritic-free tones make it accessible worldwide.
- **Logic + Emotion**: Combines logical structure (SOV, compounding like gilo = give-want) with emotional expressiveness (tones: si vs. sie vs. sia).

## Key Features
- **Phonology**: 18 consonants, 5 vowels, 10 diphthongs, 3 tones (flat, rising, falling) without diacritics. Teachable phonemes (e.g., /θ/ as “tongue tip”).
- **Grammar**: Strict SOV, isolating, with argument markers (-x, -f, -th), topic/focus markers (kan, kash), and verb compounding (e.g., loie = love-want).
- **Lexicon**: 236 roots, expandable to 300 via community proposals. Includes loanwords (e.g., kofi = coffee).
- **Vignettes**: Real-world scenarios (e.g., Junkspire Bazaar, Moonlit Rooftop) for practical use, from bartering to romance.
- **Collaborative Design**: Propose new roots for the ~64 open slots based on usability and need, shaping Líká’s evolution.
